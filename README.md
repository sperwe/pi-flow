**Give Pi a team.**

Orchestrate subagents and multi-step workflows across **Pi**, **Codex CLI**, and **Claude Code** without leaving your Pi session.

## One coordinator, focused subagents

Define subagents for **Pi**, **Codex CLI**, and **Claude Code**, then orchestrate them from one Pi session - a few parallel `run_agent` calls or a staged `run_workflow` with live progress.

| Primitive | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| **`run_agent`** | One focused, resumable subagent or several independent subagents in parallel. |
| **`run_workflow`** | Parallel or staged subagents, branching, structured results, and saved orchestration. |

## Try it

```bash
pi install npm:@kky42/pi-flow
```

Ask Pi naturally:

```text
Use three subagents in parallel to review architecture, tests, and documentation, then synthesize their findings.
```

```text
Use a workflow to classify each changed file by risk, run the matching review, and return structured results.
```

The active Tool row shows queued and running work. Pi receives the final Tool result after the direct subagent or outer workflow finishes.

### Add simple subagents

Profiles live at `~/.pi/agent/subagents/<name>.md`. The filename becomes the profile name. Codex and Claude profiles bypass their native permission prompts, so use them only in trusted repositories.

Pi-backed profiles inherit the ambient Skill catalog by default. Set `inheritSkills: false` to give a child no Skills, or set `skills: skill-a, skill-b` to expose only those names from the discovered catalog. An explicit `skills` list takes precedence over `inheritSkills`. These fields affect Pi-backed children only.
